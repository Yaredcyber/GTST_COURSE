 - ● indexing and slicing{start,stop,step}
 - ● input handling{2 methods}
 - ● Operations
 - ● indentation
 - ● if else
 - ● Errors (Exceptions)
 - ● Error handling
 - ● loops
 - ## Indexing
 - ● On lists, we have seen about index numbers.
 - ● Negative indexing
 - Note: The list index always starts with 0. Hence, the first element of a list is present at index 0, not 1.
 - Cont…
 - ● Calling texts by indexes also works for strings & tuples
?
 - ## Slicing
 - ● In Python it is possible to access a section of items from the list using the 
 - slicing operator ‘ : ‘ , not just a single item. 
 - ● Syntax:
 - ○ Mylist[ start : stop : step ]
 - ● Slicing is indexing syntax that extracts a portion from a list. If a is a list, then 
 - a[m:n] returns the portion of a:
 - ○ Starting with postion m
 - ○ Up to but not including n
 - ○ Negative indexing can also be used
 - ● It is more applicable for strings.
 - ● Python uses default step as 1, sometimes no need to tell/put it
 - ● Also default stopping index is the final, still no need to tell for this kinda 
 - purpose
 - Cont…
 
 - ## User Input handling
 - ● On python there are 2 types of inputs
 - ○ By input function
 - ○ By Arguments
 - 1) #### By input functions,
 - ○ Syntax: var = input(“Text you like to display: ”)
 - ○ Will accept the input and stores on variable
 - Cont…
 - You can change the input type to int() float() eval() str()….
 - Cont…
 - 2) #### Arguments
 - ● This help us to get the input from the command lines
 
■ WHY??
 - Further…
 - You can do more inputs
 - You can create variable until n times 
 - var = sys.argv[100]
 - ## Oprators
 - ● There are lots of operators type on python:
 - a. Arithmetic operators
 - b. Assignment Operators
 - c. Comparison Operators
 - d. Logical Operators
 - e. Bitwise Operators
 - f. Special Operators
 - A) Arithmetic Operators
 - They are a simple maths operations
 - Inputs have to be in int,eval, float only
 - B) Assignment Operators
 - ● Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
 - ● You do the arithmetic operators 1st , then the equal sign.
 - C) Comparison operators
 - ● Boolean means either TRUE or FALSE
 - D) Logical Operators
 - ● They are used to check if an expression is TRUE or FALSE
 - ● They use Truth tables to compare. 
 - Truth table for and / እና ( && )
 - ● Only True and True is True
 - Truth table for or / ወይም ( || )
 - ● Only False and False is False
 - Truth table for not / አይደለም
 - ● It is just opposite.
 - Quick Quiz
 - Bitwise Operators
 - ● Computers Work with Binarys
 - ● On our computer everything have a binary value. ( also called bit) 
 - ● On python there is a keyword called bin(YourDecimal) this helps to Show 
 - you the binary value of YourDecimal
 - ● True have a value of 1
 - ● False have a value of 0
 - ● Bitwise Operators Used to do maths(Logical operations) on The binary
 - value of The expression.
 - ● There are 
 - ○ Compliment ( Not) (~) 
 - ○ And `( & )`
 - ○ Or  `( | ) `
 - ○ Xor ( ^ )
 - ○ Left Shift `(<<)`
 - ○ Right shift `(>>)`
 - If you work on CryptoGraphy on hacking this is must!
 - Complement( NOT ) ( ~ )
 - ● It will convert the first value to binary and it will reverse each bit 
 - then converts to decimal.
 - ● In simple maths, it will add 1 to the number and then makes it 
 - negative.
 - And( & )
 - ● You can add 0 before the binary of any number if it is not 4 digit binary
 - ● bin(7) -> 111 , but we can do 0111 too
 - OR `( | )`
 - SAME AS AND but the logic operator will be changed.
 - XOR `( ^ )`
 - ● It is like and , or but the difference is the logic here is
 - ○ If they are same = `0 1^1 = 0 , 0^0 = 0`
 - ○ If they are different =` 1 1^0 = 1 , 0^1 = 1`
 - Left Shift `( << )`
 - ● Every Numbers have .0 at the end => 1.0 ,32.0 ….
 - Right shift ( >> )
 - indentations
 - ● Are Just a WhiteSpace which python uses for some of its function. If 
 - there is no proper indentation error then you are doomed. 
 - ## If-else conditions

 - ● In Python, there are three forms of the if...else statement.
 - 1. if statement
 - 2. if...else statement
 - 3. if...elif...else statement
 - If statement 
 - ● The if statement evaluates condition.
 - ○ If condition is evaluated to True, the code inside the body of if is executed.
 - ○ If condition is evaluated to False, the code inside the body of if is skipped.
 - ● Syntax:
 - ○
 - #### Indentation
 - If…else statement
 - An if statement can have an optional else clause.
 - The syntax of if...else statement is:
 - If…elif…else Statement
 - 1. Here,
 - 2. If condition1 evaluates to True, code 
 - block 1 is executed.
 - 3. If condition1 evaluates to False, then 
 - condition2 is evaluated.
 - 4. If condition2 is True, code block 2 is 
 - executed.
 - 5. If condition2 is False, code block 3 is 
 - executed.
 - Nested if statements
 - ● We can also use an if statement inside of an if statement. This is known as a 
 - nested if statement.
 - ● Here two requirements have to be true to run the body of condition2 
 - Exercise 2
 - 1) Abel wanted to make a software that accepts a number 
 - and checks a number if the number is even it displays “ 
 - This number is Even”, if the number is odd “ This 
 - number is Odd” if the input is not integer display 
 - “Please enter a number only!” else display “nothing 
 - inserted!” can you do this program for him?
 - Logical Errors ( Exceptions)
 - ● Errors that occur at runtime (after passing the syntax test) are called 
 - exceptions or logical errors.
 - ● For instance, they occur when we
 - ○ try to call an index that is greater than the list have causes ( IndexError )
 - ○ try to divide a number by zero (ZeroDivisionError)
 - ○ When you have error on your syntax (NameError) and so on.
 - ● So specially when errors occur on runtime this causes a huge damage on our 
 - Error handling
 - ● For handling errors we use try…except blocks.
 - program so we have to handle it.
 - Python Loops
 - ● In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.
 - ● For example, if we want to show a message 100 times, then we can 
 - use a loop. And print(100) It's just a simple example; you can achieve 
 - much more with loops.
 - ● There are 2 types of loops in Python:
 - ○ For Loop
 - ○ While Loop
 - For loop
 - ● In Python, the for loop is used to run a block of code for a 
 - certain number of times. It is used to iterate over any
 - sequences such as list, tuple, string, etc.
 - ● Syntax: 
 - ○ Sequence is a list,tuple,string or range.
 - ○ Val is a variable which will hold the iteration from the 
 - sequence.
 - Cont…
 - %% Range keyword
 - A range is series of values between two numeric 
 - intervals. range(size)
 - %% len keyword
 - A len is used to show the length of a sequence 
 - may be list,tuple or staffing. len(list)
 - While loops
 - ● Python while loop is used to run a specific code until a certain condition is 
 - met.
 - ● Syntax: 
 - Cont…
 - 1) You can do infinite loops
 - Difference between for and while
 - ● The for loop is usually used when the number of iterations 
 - is known.
 - ● And while loop is usually used when the number of 
 - iterations are unknown. When we have condition.
 - ● Example: 
 - ● If you have a case that wanted to check level of a user and 
 - displays “ you have passed {n}th level” n is sequence. Until 
 - the user level and the class level is equal. What do u do?
 - ● For loops: ends when the iterable is finished.
 - ● While loops: end when the condition is false.
 - break
 - Break used to exit from an infinite loop.
- Case:
- Write a program that helps to check a code , if the 
- users errors are 5 close the program and display “ 
- try again next time” else repeat and ask the code
