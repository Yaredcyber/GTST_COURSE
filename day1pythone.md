-  ### Generation of computer
- **First computer generation** use vacume tube to emit termal and proces it
- **Second computer generation** use transisitor it become assemply language
- **Thierd computer** use intergrated curcute  transisitor 
- **Fourth generation** use micro process like (Cpu)
- **Fiveth Generation**use artefical intelegence (AI)
- # computer language
- ***computer language is understod 0 and 1 (on and off) and computer only understod using assembly language or (0 and 10)**
- # A Low programing language 
 **Assemply** is  are more chalanged  for human and very easy for computer
- # High level lnaguage
 this types of computer for humand and cahallanged for computer
- # c Medium 
- Are very easy for human and computer like **c**
- **compiler**:- used to translate higleve to low level language use in changing byte code
- **interprited**:- used to change line by line code .

- Website development
- Game development
- machine language
